#### Elicitation process
All the information in this document was obtained through an informal interview with the client on April 7, 2019, he was asked questions about the functions that the website would like to have, and suggestions about some of those functions.

The client already had a design in mind for the page, the main page should contain the logo and the name of the business at the top so that when it was entered the page would be the first thing that was visible, under the logo and the name wanted a bar with different tabs that would function as hyperlinks to the other sites on the website, he mentioned that he wanted the user to click on the tab and be redirected to the corresponding tab, the suggestion was made to add in addition to that the option that when the user puts his cursor on a tab a menu will be displayed with the hyperlinks related to that tab giving the option to the user to go directly to the section he wanted, the client accessed this function and it was agreed to make the tab bar in this way, both the logo and name at the top of the page and the tab bar below, is something that will be present you in all the sites of the web page according to the client. He also mentioned that under the bar he wanted a slider of images that contained the 8 most representative photographs of his work selected by him, the slider must contain a button on the left and one on the right side so that users can move between the images.

In the contact tab, the client wants to show the necessary information so that users can contact the owner of the business, specific that it must contain the same structure as the home page, which would be the logo and name in the top of the page, the tab bar below the logo as mentioned above.

In the about us tab, the client wants to show the information related to the business so that users can know about the origin of the business and those involved in it. As specified above, the structure of the logo and the tab bar is applied in the same way, the logo and name on the top and below the tab bar. Under the tab bar you will find a section with a brief history of the business and the text of the story should be justified, below the history of the business you should find a presentation section, in which a photograph should appear of those involved in the business with their name and a brief introduction of themselves, the photograph must go from the left side and the text must be justified and surrounding the photograph.

In the calendar tab, the structure of the logo and name is followed in the upper part and below the tab bar.

A legal notice must be added specifying that the use of the electronic mail is only for communication purposes and that the information will not be used or sold to third parties, this notice must be just below the form buttons where the user can read it.

The information should go from the left side just below the tab bar. Under all packages you should find a legal notice informing that the price of the packages may be subject to price and availability changes.

#### Process
With this the part of the functions of the website was terminated, now the client told us how the process should be on the page, the process begins when the user enters the website.

When the user enters the web page must be redirected to the main page, on this page the user can check the page and decide if it is of interest, here the user can click on the tabs to see the other sections of the web page depending on what is of your interest.

If the user wants to see the "contact" section, he / she must click on the contact tab and this will be redirected to the contact page, here the user can observe the information that is provided or contact the manager directly through the page, if you want to contact the manager through the page you must fill out the form that is on the page, you must enter your name, your mail and a description with the questions you have or the reason why you are contacting the person in charge, the user has the option to send the information or clean the form in case of having made a mistake in the data he entered. When you press the send button, an email is sent to the business email account and is received by the administrator assistant, once the assistant receives the email, it verifies the user's information and depending on the description provided by the assistant contact to answer your questions, according to the medium that the user gave the contact is done by phone or email, if both media were provided the priority will be to contact him by phone because it is a faster and more direct than the email. The contact process would be this way, the response time may vary, but on average it takes 2 to 3 hours to respond to the user once the assistant received the email.

If the user wants to know about the business, then you must click on the "About us" tab to be redirected to it, here you will find the history of the business, as well as the people who are related to it.

When the assistant receives the email, it reviews the user's data and work requirements and then evaluates whether the work can be done, if it is possible to carry out the work, the assistant contacts the person in charge, the person in charge reviews the information and assigns a photographer for the event, the photographer confirms the data and the information is provided to the assistant again, once the assistant has all the work information contact the user, the means of contact depends on the information provided by the user, if I provide email and phone, priority is given to contacting a phone call as it is a faster and more direct means.

If the user is interested in seeing the previous work of the business, you can click on the "Previous Works" tab, where you can see image galleries according to the types of events, depending on the type of event you want to see, the user you only have to click on the gallery of your choice to see the images, if you click on an image you enter in full screen mode and if you want you can go back to see the other galleries.

Finally, if the client wants to see the information related to the packages already established, he should only click on the "Package" tab and there he will be able to see all the information.

Once the client finished specifying the process, the functions and the order he wanted the web page to have, he checked the requirements to ensure that they were interpreted in the way he had wanted it, the client accepted the way that the requirements were interpreted and these requirements were added to the SRS document.
